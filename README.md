# Example C project structure with CMake and clangd LSP
This is an example of how to set up a C project using CMake and clangd LSP.

# How to use
This example uses CMakePresets to configure the build system. With them, you can:
- Configure the build system:
    ```bash
    cmake --preset default
    ```
- Build the project:
    ```bash
    cmake --build --preset default
    ```
Without CMakePresets, you would have to run:
- Configure the build system:
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
    # or
    # cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
    ```
- Build the project:
    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    # or
    # cd build && make
    ```

# Structure
The project structure is as follows:
- `src/`: The source code directory containing the C files.
- `include/`: The header files directory.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: The CMake configuration file that defines the build process.
- `CMakePresets.json`: The CMake presets file that defines the build configurations.
- `compile_commands.json`: symlink to the compile commands file generated by CMake, which is used by clangd for 
code completion and navigation.
- `main.c`: The main C source file that contains the entry point of the program.
- `build/`: The build directory where the compiled files will be placed. Empty at the start.
